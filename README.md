### About this Dataset
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.


## Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory ```Diabetes-prediction/```  (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```ipython notebook Diabetes-prediction.ipynb```

or

```jupyter notebook Diabetes-prediction.ipynb```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
